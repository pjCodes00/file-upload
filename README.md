# fileupload-freeCodeCamp 

This project is a file upload app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It is originally created by software developer John Smilga from freeCodeCamp. I followed his tutorial to deepen my understanding of working with APIs and building interactive web applications.

Here are the tutorials I used to learn Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB from freeCodeCamp, taught by software developer John Smilga:

In this app, users can enter a product name, price, and upload an image using the "Choose File" button, the image gets uploaded to cloudinary. Once submitted, the product details are stored in a MongoDB database. Users are then redirected to a products page that fetches and displays all product information using a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project showcases fundamental concepts such as DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, as well as backend integration, API-based data retrieval and data storage using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: 
  1.Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  2.Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  3.Database: MongoDB
  4.File Upload: express-fileupload, Cloudinary


This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. I used John Smilga/freeCodeCamp's tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end and back-end development skills.
